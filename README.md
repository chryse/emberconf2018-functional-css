# EmberConf 2018 Training â€“Â Functional CSS

Hi there!

We're super excited that you're attending our **Functional CSS** training at EmberConf on Monday. ðŸ˜€

Follow the steps below to make sure your computer is set up with our training app.

Conference WiFi isn't super reliable, so we recommend doing the setup ahead of time, at home or work.

We'll ask that you `git pull` one more time the morning of the training to get the latest code, but the core modules shouldn't change much.

# Setup

> We're using a few new addons, so if you have any trouble getting started just shoot us an email at [info@embermap.com](mailto:info@embermap.com).

## Node.js

We're using Node.js 8.9.4, which is the current LTS version.

## App

To get this app on your computer,

1. Open terminal
2. Clone this git repository: `git clone git@github.com:embermap/emberconf2018-functional-css.git`
3. Move into the directory: `cd emberconf2018-functional-css`
4. Run NPM install: `npm install` (You might get some warnings, thats ok!)
5. Serve the app `ember s`
6. If you can see the screen below, you're all set!
